# Battleship Game(single player)


## How to play! 

- When the game has been run you will be prompted to select a row and column between 1-8 and A-H

- If you hit a ship it will return with X on that location to show thats a hit

- If you miss a shot it will return -

- You have 10 turns to try and hit all 5 ships 

- Goodluck!


### Features Left to Implement

- A feature that i would like to have implemented would be a highscore system, where you would enter your name and it will store the highest amount of ships hit within the 10 turns
